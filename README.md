📱 Old Phone Price Prediction System

Project Description:

The Old Phone Price Prediction System is a machine learning–based application designed to estimate the resale price of used smartphones based on key features such as brand, model, age, RAM, storage, battery capacity, camera specifications, and physical condition. The goal of this project is to help users, sellers, and e-commerce platforms determine a fair and data-driven price for second-hand mobile devices.

The project involves collecting and preprocessing smartphone datasets, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand pricing trends, and building regression models to predict phone prices accurately. Various machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting are evaluated to identify the best-performing model. Feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning are applied to improve prediction accuracy.

The final model can be integrated into a web application where users input phone specifications and receive an estimated resale price instantly. This project demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, regression modeling, model evaluation, and end-to-end machine learning pipeline development.
